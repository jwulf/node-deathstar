atm clients poll the server twice a second for changes. Changed pages are rendered to html on the server, and then sent to the client.

Better would be:

1. Client-side rendering from JSON.

Instead of server-side rendering, use underscore.js to do the rendering on the client. 

At the moment pages are re-rendered based on the current state of the books object. Would it be more efficient to send the books object to the client and have the client render the page?

2. Get rid of polling.

Clients open a websocket and pass back the name of the page they are registering to. When something on the server changes, a change is pushed to the client.
