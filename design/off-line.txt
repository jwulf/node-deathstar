Off line operation

Request from ekopalova

Once live update editing is implemented, offline operation becomes possible.

Rebuilding of the book is obviated by live update editing - the book is dynamically updated and does not require a rebuild. 


Step One:
Move topic loading and saving to the server. The browser asks the server for the topic load/save action, and the server carries it out in either online or off-line mode.
This makes it transparent to the client in the browser.





## Phase One

Note: Structural editing is not supported in Phase One.

A book is taken offline. All the topics in the book are retrieved from the server and persisted to the local filesystem.

When edits are performed in offline mode, the edits are persisted to the local filesystem, and the topic is set to dirty.

When the book is taken back online, all dirty topics are pushed to the server, and a rebuild performed.

And that's all there is to that.

When the editor is invoked, it asks the Death Star server if the book is offline mode. If it is, then the offline API is used for loading and saving the topic from the editor.

That's pretty easy, actually.

The offline API is a file system writer in the Death Star server, similar to the jsondb API used to store the book metadata locally.
