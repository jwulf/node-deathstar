We put the Revision_History.xml in the topic description field.


During build, if the Spec topic has a topic description set, then we overwrite 
the generated Rev History with the contents of the topic description.

When building the book, if we replaced the Revision History with the topic 
description, during deathStarItUp() we will inject a special editor link 
into the Revision History, which can be located like this:

$('div.appendix').each(function(){if ($(this).find('h1').text() == 'Revision History') console.log(this)});

The editor link needs to inform the Death Star editor to edit the topic description field, rather than the xml field.

This should be pretty easy. We make the field a variable, and default it to 
xml. If the right parameter is passed on the url, we make it the 'description' 
field.

OK, let's try this.
