External Editor Support

Request from ekopalova

The Firefox add-on "It's All Text" allows external editors to be used to edit text areas. 

It should be possible to mimic whatever they are doing in the editor javascript. Look into it, and provide support for editing topics with an external editor.


*** Update 11 April 2013

Implemented by adding a "Plain Text Editor" button to the editor. This switches the Code Mirror off and replaces it with a plain text area. This allows the Firefox It's All Text extension to work.
