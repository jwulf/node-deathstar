        <h3>"Now witness the firepower of this fully ARMED and OPERATIONAL battle station!!"</h3>
           
            <p><i>"Editing a spec in deathstar = awesome"</i>
        <br><i>"The Deathstar editor rocks. It rocks pretty hard, making it easier for all of us to work with our new topic-based authoring tools."</i></p>
        
        <p>The Deathstar is a web-browser based workflow for authoring books using topic-based authoring.</p>
        
        <p>It is completely open-source (<a href="https://github.com/jwulf/node-deathstar">hosted on github</a>) and community-based. It is not an official product of any company.</p>
        
       <p>"Death Star is "Fedora" to PressGang's "RHEL" - roughly. Like using Fedora as your operating system (versus using the Corporate Standard Build of RHEL), Death Star is not "officially supported". Death Star is a community-supported open source tool chain for Docbook XML authoring that builds on Publican and PressGang to provide authors with new and useful features that are not yet implemented in those tools. Like Fedora, Death Star evolves rapidly. Like RHEL, PressGang provides a stable platform and incorporates features that frequently first appear in the Death Star. As Fedora does with RHEL Engineering, Death Star relies on PressGang and the PressGang developers."
